# EEG-Command-Demo

**EEG-Controlled Demo using real-time brainwave signals to control external devices through mental commands.**

This project demonstrates how to use real-time EEG data to control external devices using mental commands. We utilize the **EMOTIV EPOC X**, a 14-channel EEG headset, to capture brainwave signals and interpret them as control inputs for interactive systems.

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Real-time EEG signal acquisition from the EMOTIV EPOC X
- Brain-computer interface (BCI) for hands-free device control
- Python-based implementation with modular structure
- Extensible framework for adding new command types or hardware interfaces

## ðŸš€ Use Cases

- Smart home control (e.g., lights, fans)
- Accessibility solutions for individuals with limited mobility
- Experimental setup for BCI research and development

## ðŸ§  Hardware Requirements

- **EMOTIV EPOC X** (14-channel EEG headset)
- Bluetooth or USB receiver for data streaming
- Optional: External device (e.g., relay, lamp, etc.) for demonstration
